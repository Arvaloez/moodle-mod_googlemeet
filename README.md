# Google Meet™ for Moodle #

The Google Meet™ for Moodle plugin allows the teacher, without having to leave Moodle, to create a Google Meet room and make available to the students the recordings of the room saved in Google Drive.

To create the Google Meet meeting room from Moodle, the Google Meet™ for Moodle plugin needs the API key and the OAuth client ID of the Google APIs.
